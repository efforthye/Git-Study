# Yarn Project 생성 기초작업
- npm i -g yarn
- yarn create react-app maple-web-project -> 스크립트 실행 에러남
- Windows PowerShell 앱 관리자로 실행
- 현재 권한 상태 확인 : [get-ExecutionPolicy]
  상태값 "Restricted" : 로컬에서 작성한 스크립트를 실행할 수 없는상태
- 스크립트 실행 권한 변경 : [Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned] - [y]
- 현재 권한 상태 확인 : [get-ExecutionPolicy]
  상태값 "RemoteSigned" 로 변경됨
- yarn create react-app maple-web-project


# 권한 상태값
- Restricted : default설정값으로, 스크립트 파일을 실행할 수 없습니다.
- AllSigned : 신뢰할 수 있는(서명된) 스크립트 파일만 실행할 수 있습니다.
- RemoteSigned : 로컬에서 본인이 생성한 스크립트와, 신뢰할 수 있는(서명된) 스크립트 파일 실행할 수 있습니다.
- Unrestricted : 모든 스크립트 실행가능
- ByPass : 경고/차단 없이 모든 것을 실행가능하도록함
- Undefined : 권한을 설정하지 않겠음

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
